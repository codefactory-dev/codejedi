Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n. 

    Example 1:

    Input: n = 10
    Output: 4
    Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 
    7.

    Example 2:

    Input: n = 0
    Output: 0

    Example 3:

    Input: n = 1
    Output: 0
 

    Constraints:

    0 <= n <= 5 * 106
