`\nWrite a function:\n\n    function solution(A);\n\nthat, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum among all one-digit integers.\n\nFor example, given array A as follows:\n    [-6, -91, 1011, -100, 84, -22, 0, 1, 473]\n\nthe function should return 1.\n\nAssume that:\n\n    * N is an integer within the range [1..1,000];\n    * each element of array A is an integer within the range\n      [-10,000..10,000];\n    * there is at least one element in array A which satisfies the\n      condition in the task statement.\n\nIn your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.`
