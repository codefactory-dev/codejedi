`\nWrite a function solution that, given a string S consisting of N\ncharacters, returns the alphabetically smallest string that can be obtained by removing exactly one letter from S.\n\nExamples:\n\n1. Given S="acb", by removing one letter, you can obtain "ac", "ab" or\n"cb". Your function should return "ab" (after removing 'c') since it is\nalphabetically smaller than "ac" and "bc".\n\n2. Given S = "hot", your function should return "ho", which is alphabetically smaller than "ht" and "ot".\n\n3. Given S = "codility", your function should return "cdility", which can be obtained by removing the second letter.\n\n4. Given S = "aaaa", your function should return "aaa". Any occurrence of\n'a' can be removed.\n\nWrite an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:\n\n    * N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];\n\n    * string S consists only of lowercase letters (a-z).`
