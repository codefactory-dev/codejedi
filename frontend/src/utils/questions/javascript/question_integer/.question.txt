\nGiven a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:\n\n	1. If n is even, replace n with n/2.\n	2. If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.\n	\nWhat is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?\n\nExample 1:\n\n	Input:\n	8\n\n	Output:\n	3\n\n	Explanation:\n	8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1\n	\nExample 2:\n\n	Input:\n	7\n\n	Output:\n	4\n\n	Explanation:\n	7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1\n	or\n	7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1\n
